* ad hoc networks : spontaniously formed networks when devices connect and communicate with each other. 

* MANET is an abbreviation for mobile ad hocnetwork it is also referred to as wireless ad hoc network it is an uninterrupted self-configuring, infrastructure-less network of mobile devices connected without making use of wires.

=> Characteristics : 
* no fixed infrastructure (in fixed infrastructure, for example there will be a tower and devices will be connected to that tower)
* no fixed topology 
* node in manet can act as either a host or as a router
* nodes are mobile in nature
* autonomous
* distributed(there is no central point in forming connection)
* limited security(since a malicious user can easily establish connection)
* energy constained nodes (since nodes are mobile and recharging the nodes could become difficult, ie, at one location the charge of the node will be 90% and after moving to location 2 it could become 60%)


=> Properties :
* fast network establishment
* peer to peer connectivity
* independent computation
* no requirement of access point
* Less wireless connectivity range(since limitted power supply compared to towers having bigger antenna amd power supply)


=> Challenges :
* Maintaining the topology is difficult since it is dynamic
* Security is limitted
* Bandwidth is variable since there is no fixed infrastructure and the bandwifth will be depended upon the power of the device or the node
* Nodes are energy constrained
* Routing is difficult since nodes are mobile, bandwidth is variable, possibility of signal loss and resources are limited
